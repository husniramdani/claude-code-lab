## Article Development Workflow

1. Create a new folder with format `YYYY-MM-article-title`
2. Add article content in `article.md`
3. Include any code examples in the `code/` subdirectory
4. Add images and assets to the `assets/` subdirectory
5. Document publication status and notes in `README.md`

## Publishing Guidelines

- Each article should be self-contained
- Include all necessary assets and code examples
- Use clear, descriptive folder names
- Keep track of publication status and links
